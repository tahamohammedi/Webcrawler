## Why

Its nice to have a convenient way to change your soup into dict.

## Installation

Get package with pip or poetry

```sh
pip install soup2dict
```

```sh
poetry add soup2dict
```

## Example

```python
import simplejson
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

from soup2dict import convert

html_doc = """
<html>
hei
<head>
    <title>The Dormouse's story</title>
    <title>bob</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="title">The <b>Dormouse's story</b></p>
    <p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters;
    and their names were
    <a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
    <a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
    <a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
    and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

    <p class="story">...</p>
"""


# Create soup from html_doc data
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')

# Convert it to a dictionary with convert()
dict_result = convert(soup)

with open('output.json', 'w') as output_file:
    output_file.write(
        simplejson.dumps(dict_result, indent=2),
    )

```
